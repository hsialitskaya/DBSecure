# üìäü™™ Insurance Agency Database: Agent and Policy Management System ü™™üìä  

The Insurance Agency Database is a robust system designed to manage a network of insurance agents and the policies they sell. It stores detailed information about agents, including their personal details, sales performance, and the specific insurance policies they are responsible for. Each policy has important attributes, such as coverage type and premium amount.

# üíª Technologies Used

Insurance Agency Database: Agent and Policy Management System is built using the following technologies:

üìç PostgreSQL


# üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with the Insurance Agency Database, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  

Download the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsialitskaya/DBSecure.git
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up PostgreSQL

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can download and install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). 

After installation, ensure the PostgreSQL service is running. For example, on Linux, you can run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Database

Once PostgreSQL is installed and running, open the PostgreSQL command line tool:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

Create the database for the insurance agency:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE insurance_agency;
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Database Schema

After creating the database, you need to set up the tables and relationships. Navigate to the folder containing the repository and open the create.sql file. This file contains the SQL queries needed to create the necessary tables, such as agents, policies, and sales.

Run the SQL script to set up the schema:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f create.sql
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Populate the Database with Sample Data

To test the database, you can populate it with sample data. Open the data.sql file and run the following command to insert sample records:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f insert.sql
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Alterations to the Schema

After inserting data into the tables, you might need to apply additional modifications, such as altering table structures or adding new fields. To do this, open the alter.sql file, which contains SQL queries for modifying existing tables.

Run the SQL script to apply the alterations:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f alter.sql
```

This will update the schema by adding or modifying columns, constraints, or indexes as needed.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Add Additional Modifications

After creating the core tables and schema, you can add additional database objects that are necessary for the application. These might include custom views, stored procedures, or triggers.

To do this, navigate to the additional.sql file, which contains extra SQL statements to enhance the database. This file could include commands to create views, add indexes, or alter tables with additional fields.

To apply the modifications from additional.sql, run the following:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f additional.sql
```

8Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Database

After setting up the database and adding sample data, you can test the connection by querying the database. For example, to view all policies, run:

```bash
SELECT * FROM polisa;
```

9Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Data from the Database (Optional)

If you need to remove data from the database (but not drop the entire database), you can use the delete.sql file. This file contains SQL queries that will delete data from specific tables, such as agents, policies, and other records, without removing the structure of the tables.

If you've applied additional modifications using the additional.sql file in step 7Ô∏è‚É£ (e.g., added custom views, indexes, or other database objects), you should first remove those modifications before deleting data.

To remove the modifications, run the delete_additional.sql script, which contains SQL queries to drop any views, indexes, or other objects added during the modification step.

To execute this, run the following command:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f delete_additional.sql
```

This will remove any additional database objects created in step 7Ô∏è‚É£.

To execute the deletion run the SQL script to delete data from the relevant tables (without dropping the tables themselves):

```bash
psql -U postgres -d insurance_agency -f delete.sql
```

This will delete all the data from the specified tables but leave the tables and their structure intact.

Important:
Ensure that you have backed up any important data before running the delete script, as this operation cannot be undone.  
If you want to completely remove the tables and the database, you can follow the "Remove the Database" steps mentioned in step 10 below.


üîü Remove the Database (Optional)

If you ever need to delete the insurance_agency database entirely (including all tables and data), follow these steps. Be careful, as this will permanently remove the database and all its data.

Disconnect from the database if you're currently connected:
```bash
\q
```

Drop the database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE insurance_agency;"
```

 üÜò **This will delete the insurance_agency database and all its contents. Make sure to back up any important data before executing this command.** üÜò
